Through this project I was able to gain a solid(not advanced) understanding of the fundamental working of Google search engine and visualized it using matrices in MATLAB. It includes exploration of background math(Linear Algebra and Graph representaion) and breif coding concepts to put it all together. I hope it helps you get a good start
